00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
>>> Welcome to Stanford CS193P, this is winter quarter 2015
欢迎来到斯坦福 CS193P，这里是2015年冬季课程。

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And we're gonna dive right in today to some brief slide work.
我们今天将直接开始深入执行一些简短幻灯片中的任务。

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This people at Stanford, you've got a document that describe,
在坐的各位斯坦福同学，你们已经拿到了介绍的资料，

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
describes all the grading and all that stuff so

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not gonna go over that in lecture like I often do start the quarter.
这次我在第一节课上不会像往届重复提到这些内容。

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Instead I'm gonna talk a little bit about what this class is about.
这次我只会简单介绍一下这门课程。

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Brief mention of the prerequisites cuz they're pretty important in this class.


11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then just the [NOISE] quickest overview of iOS.


12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm gonna assume that anyone who is here or is watching this, knows what this is.
我会假定你们每个人都看了这些，知道这是些什么。

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And then, we're gonna dive right into a big old demo.
之后，我们会直接深入一个大型 demo。

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's gonna be a two-day thing, where I'm really going to try and

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
introduce you to Xcode and the development environment and

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
this language Swift, that you're gonna have to learn to develop for iOS.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right, so what is this class about?

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's about building cool apps, as we know.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why are these iOS apps so cool?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, because the device you're gonna run them on is in your pocket or
因为这些 app 将运行在你口袋中的设备（iPhone）

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
in your backpack.
或你书包中的设备（iPad）。

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
it's highly networked and incredible graphics with animation.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's just cool all the way around and I think you guys all know that or

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you wouldn't be here.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But you're also gonna learn in 

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
this class a lot of real life Object-Oriented Programming.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're taking a lot of other classes here at Stanford on things like graphic. and

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
networking, and databases, and maybe animation.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Things like that.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And we're gonna is kinda tie that all together into a real world class.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
OK? You're gonna get to see all this stuff.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, you know, it's gonna be kind of a survey course in that,

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can't go too deep into networking.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can't go too deep into databases.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't go too deep into animation, but you'll get to see it all in a really real

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
world environment, where people our there building apps using that technology.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For some of you who haven't seen that before that'll be a big bonus of

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
this class, I think.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The prerequisites of this class.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No.1 thing is you have to be a pretty strong Object-Oriented programmer.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you're not a strong Object-Oriented programmer, and

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you hit this class, you're probably gonna go under water, pretty quick.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
OK? I'm gonna assume you know,

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
everything about Object-Oriented Programming.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
iOS is a completely Object-Oriented Programming environment,

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
development environment,

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I just don't mean I'm not just talking about the language is Object-Oriented.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But the entire design of it the way you use it if you're not

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
comfortable with things like subclassing and

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
stuff like that then you're just really gonna be behind the curve.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In iOS so at Stanford here that means CS16A and B or

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
CS16X, and then you know, CS107, while it's not really Object-Oriented course,

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
at least it's heavy duty programming course.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CS108 is a great Object-Oriented course so 

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
if you have, if you've taken CS108 you'll probably, be really well prepped.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
110, again not really too much an Object-Oriented program but 

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
good programming course cuz there's a lot of programming in this class,

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
in fact, all the work in this class is programming.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your will not have, a little bit of reading the first couple of weeks just to

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
kinda learn this new language, but it's almost all programming after that all

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the way til the end, including your final project.

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So if you're not really comfortable with all these terms,

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
this Object-Oriented terms or if you're just not really comfortable with

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
writing big programs then this class will definitely be a challenge for you.

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OK, so what's in iOS, what are the parts of it?
好了，那么 iOS 内部都有些什么东西呢？

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You know, it's ha, its's such a big system, it's got so much in it.
你知道，这是一个很大的系统，这个系统包含大量的内容。

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's impossible for me to
对我来说，几乎不可能

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
like, encapsulate it into a small little summary but
把所有的内容浓缩成一个小小的总结，但是

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I do have this slide right here that divides it into these four layers.
我这里有些幻灯片，把它们划分为四个层面。
